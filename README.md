## About Me

I'm a PhD student studying at George Washington University located in Washington, D.C.  My research interests lie at the intersection of graph theory, machine learning, and cybersecurity.  I'm researching ways to apply deep learning to graph structured data specifically to address issues related to cybersecurity.

I received a B.S. in computer engineering from the University of Maryland at College park in 2013.  I spent 4 years working as a software engineer for AT&T before returning to pursue my PhD full time in 2017.
