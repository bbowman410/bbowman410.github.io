## About Me

I'm a PhD student studying at the George Washington University located in the heart of Washington, D.C.  My research advisor is [Dr. Howie Huang](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~howie/).  My research interests lie at the intersection of graph theory, machine learning, and cybersecurity.  I'm interested in researching ways to apply deep learning to graph structured data specifically to address issues related to cybersecurity.

I received a B.S. in computer engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park in 2013.  After graduating I spent 4 years working as a software engineer at AT&T Government Solutions developing cybersecurity products for industry and government partners.  In 2017 I began my full-time pursuit of my PhD at GWU.
